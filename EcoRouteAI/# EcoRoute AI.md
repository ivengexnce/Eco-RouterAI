# EcoRoute AI

EcoRoute AI is a mobile application designed to optimize route planning using AI and machine learning. It aims to reduce fuel consumption, traffic congestion, and environmental impact by providing real-time and predictive route suggestions.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Traffic Updates**: Provides up-to-date traffic information.
- **Environmental Impact Scores**: Evaluates routes based on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- **Predictive Traffic Patterns**: Uses machine learning to forecast future traffic conditions.
- **Customizable Route Preferences**: Allows users to prioritize routes based on speed, eco-friendliness, or congestion levels.
- **Integration with Navigation Apps**: Works seamlessly with existing navigation tools.

## AI/ML Components
- **Traffic Prediction Model**: Trained on historical traffic data, weather forecasts, and event data using time series forecasting techniques like LSTM or ARIMA.
- **Route Optimization Algorithm**: Implements A* or Dijkstra’s algorithm, considering environmental impact as a cost factor.

## Technologies Used
- **Mapping Libraries**: Open-source tools like Leaflet or OpenLayers.
- **Traffic Data APIs**: Open traffic data sources for real-time updates.
- **Cloud-based ML Services**: Platforms like Google Cloud AI or AWS SageMaker.
